It's 2023, and that means it's the year of the blog! Or at least, that's what I've agreed it will be, with the following terms:

- I commit to publishing a blog post, usually of a technical nature, every two weeks on Sunday, starting January 15th, 2023
- Blogs can come early, purely for scheduling flexibility
- There's no minimum word count for a post, but the honor system I'm maintaing for myself is that I won't post something inherently wasteful
- I'm sharing this commitment with [Quinten Palmer](https://github.com/quintenpalmer), who will also be posting biweekly! Expect a link to his posts soon!

Why do this? A few reasons:
- Writing is a valuable part of being a technical worker, and this commitment will give me an avenue and a responsibilty to practice my writing
- I'm working on a side project, a SaaS bartender application that I'll be introducing more fully next time, and this blog will serve as an avenue to discuss that project and its development
- As I've grown in my career, I've moved away from creative work for most of my workday. My side project, and this blog, will hopefully fill a creative hole that I feel building in my heart.
